# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Update the `secp256k1` dependency.

## 0.9.0-beta.1 - 2024-09-29

### Changed

- Bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.70.
- Update the `secp256k1` dependency.

### Fixed

- Fix missing JWK helpers when compiling the crate with the `p256` feature.

## 0.8.0 - 2023-10-12

*(All changes are relative compared to [the 0.8.0-beta.1 release](#080-beta1---2023-06-09))*

### Added

- Support floating-point timestamps in claims.

### Security

- Update `ed25519-dalek` dependency, fixing a potential vulnerability as described in [RUSTSEC-2022-0093](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0093).
- Replace unmaintained `serde_cbor` dependency with `ciborium`.

## 0.8.0-beta.1 - 2023-06-09

### Added

- Support padding in base64url encoding of certificate thumbprints in the JWT header.

### Changed

- Update `secp256k1` and `rsa` dependencies.
- Make JWT `Header` generic similar to `Claims`, so that it contain custom fields
  as per [Section 4.2 of RFC 7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.2).
  Since `Default` is now implemented for all `Header<T: Default>`, one should use
  a new `Header::empty()` method to create an empty header, and `Header::new()` to create
  a header with custom fields.
- Take `Header<_>` by reference in `AlgorithmExt` methods creating tokens (previously,
  it was taken by value).
- Support custom-encoded certificate thumbprints in JWT `Header` by replacing types
  of the corresponding fields with a new `Thumbprint` enum. As an example,
  this allows hex-encoded thumbprints (which are then additionally base64url-encoded)
  produced by some software.

### Deprecated

- Deprecate `validate_integrity` and `validate_for_signed_token` methods in `AlgorithmExt`.
  An extended version of this functionality, which can validate tokens with custom headers,
  is now encapsulated in the new `Validator` type, which is returned
  by the new `AlgorithmExt::validator()` method.

## 0.7.0 - 2023-03-14

### Changed

- Update dependencies and bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.65.
- Rename the `with_rsa` feature to `rsa`.

## 0.6.0 - 2022-11-01

### Added

- Add ES256 implementation using pure-Rust [`p256`] crate.

### Changed

- Update dependencies, bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.60 and switch to 2021 Rust edition.

## 0.5.0 - 2021-12-29

*(All changes are relative compared to [the 0.5.0-beta.1 release](#050-beta1---2021-10-21))*

### Added

- Add `UntrustedToken::into_owned()` method to extend the token lifetime to static.
  This is useful if an `UntrustedToken` needs to be stashed / passed across threads.
- Add `UntrustedToken::deserialize_claims_unchecked()` to extract claims from a token
  without verification. As the name length implies, the method should only be used
  in exceptional cases.
- Implement `FromStr` and some standard traits (`Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`) for `Rsa`.
- Introduce `AlgorithmSignature::LENGTH` constant for specifying the expected 
  signature length. The new `ValidationError::InvalidSignatureLen` variant provides
  more specific errors if the signature length is not as specified.
- Allow opting out from CBOR claims encoding by making `serde_cbor` dependency optional
  and using it as a crate feature. The relevant functionality (`AlgorithmExt::compact_token`,
  some error variants, etc.) is now gated behind this feature.
  This change is motivated by the fact that supporting verification of CBOR-encoded tokens 
  has non-zero cost for library users (e.g., in terms of code size or security analysis).

## 0.5.0-beta.1 - 2021-10-21

### Changed

- Update dependencies.

### Fixed

- Fix datetime overflow when validating the expiration claim.
- Fix `no_std` support for RSA-based JWS algorithms. As a part of the fix,
  to enable RSA, you should now use the `rsa` feature instead of `rsa`.

### Security

- Use constant-time base64 encoding / decoding from the [`base64ct`] crate.

## 0.4.0 - 2021-05-24

### Added

- Add `new()` constructor for `HS*` keys that accepts any type implementing
  `AsRef<[u8]>`. This simplifies key loading.
- Add `new()` constructor for `UntrustedToken` that accepts any type implementing
  `AsRef<str>`. This simplifies token processing.
- Add basic JSON Web Key (JWK) support. This allows (de)serializing keys from / into
  a uniform format and computing key thumbprints.
- Add ES256K implementation using pure-Rust [`k256`] crate.

### Changed

- Update dependencies.
- Rename `Header.signature_type` field to `token_type` to be more in line with JWT spec.
- Rename `Claims.expiration_date` to `expiration` to be more precise.
- Encapsulate `hmac` and `sha2` dependencies by introducing signature types 
  for `HS*` algorithms. The `digest` dependency is still public.
- `exonum-crypto` feature is no longer enabled by default.
- Change return type of `SigningKey::as_bytes()` to securely zeroize owned values on drop.

### Fixed

- Fix ES256K signature verification by accepting high-S signatures, which are still produced
  by some third-party implementations (e.g., OpenSSL).

## 0.3.0 - 2020-11-30

No substantial changes compared to the 0.3.0-beta.2 release.

## 0.3.0-beta.2 - 2020-11-09

*(All changes are relative compared to [the 0.3.0-beta.1 release](#030-beta1---2020-11-08))*

### Changed

- Make `CreationError` non-exhaustive.
- Rename `StrongKey::inner()` method to `into_inner`.

### Fixed

- Fix `docs.rs` configuration.

## 0.3.0-beta.1 - 2020-11-08

### Added

- Add signature getters for untrusted and trusted tokens.
- Add the [`ed25519-compact`] backend for Ed25519-based tokens.
- Add `SigningKey` and `VerifyingKey` traits for generic access to cryptographic keys.
- Support RSA algorithms using pure-Rust [`rsa`] crate.
- Add `no_std` mode and check `no_std` / WASM compatibility via dedicated aux crates.
  Introduce two relevant crate features, `clock` and `std`.
- Add wrapper types for strong keys / JWT algorithms.
- Add details to some `ValidationError` variants.

### Changed

- Update dependencies.
- Update minimum supported Rust version due to dependencies.
- `es256k` feature should now be used for access to libsecp256k1 backend instead of
  `secp256k1`.
- Rework time-related token creation / validation logic. It is now possible to
  use a custom clock, which could be useful for testing or if there is no access
  to the system clock.
- Make `Header`, `Claims`, `TimeOptions`, and error types non-exhaustive.

## 0.2.0 - 2020-05-11

### Changed

- Update dependencies; replace `failure` error handling with `anyhow`.

## 0.1.0 - 2019-07-01

The initial release of `jwt-compact`.
